# Reading Material Browser Week 2

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 2:

1. [Agile development](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/agile)
2. [Revisit Naming conventions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/programming/naming-conventions)
3. [DRY](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself)
3. [Incremental Coding](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/incremental-coding)
4. [Presenting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module)
5. [Group Project time!](../PROJECT.md)


## Week(s) goals
In the next 2 weeks you will be working on a group project with guidance from a mentor! This will be your first experience of working on code together, which is what you will be doing daily at your job. As a group, you will be building a quiz app, combining everything you have learned so far (html/css/js) in a practical example. Once completed, you will have an individual 'mock tech interview' about the application you have built. These kinds of interviews are very similar to what you will encounter when you start looking for a job so it is a good time to already start practicing. Luckily you are working on the presentation module as well this week which will help you with this!

Learn more about the project [here](../PROJECT.md). The project will start on Sunday, to prepare even more for that the upcoming days we would like you to have a look at some information about working together and how software development teams do that. Your study book has a nice section on agile [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/agile). This is based on bigger teams and projects, but it should give you an indication of how software developers work and your mentors may use some of these terms when guiding you through the project.

This will also be the first time you are going to work with bigger code bases and less defined problems. It is therefore a good idea to revisit some of the material that was mentioned in your JavaScript module on coding practices. Refresh your memory on the topic of [Naming conventions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/programming/naming-conventions) and have a look at the [DRY principle](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself). We would also like to introduce you to a technique that programmers use to be able to solve problems in such a way that you do not get lost: Incremental Coding. Read all about it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/incremental-coding) and get into the habit of using this technique whenever you are solving a tough problem like the ones you will face in the project! It will save you a lot of headaches.

Besides that we will also work on our soft skills by reading up on the principles of presenting in the [presentation module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/).
