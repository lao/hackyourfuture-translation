# Module #3 - Browsers

![Browsers](./assets/browsers.png)

If you were to ask a random person on the street the question "What is a browser?", you'll most likely get a variety of (incorrect) answers. For proof, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ) out.

You might be one of those people right now, but after this module no more. In **Browsers** you'll learn all about how the browsers work and how to use the JavaScript you just learned within the browser.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Understand what the `DOM` is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`
- Build a cool quiz website from scratch as a group
- Learn how to present yourself and your code

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 2 essential parts per week:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the homework. It contains the list of concepts that you will want to study this week and points you to your study book to read all about them. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the Browsers module. This is what you do...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `Browsers`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's homework (from the JavaScript1 module)
3. On **Friday** you start with the homework, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `Browsers`, that would be [Week1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the class channel
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend class. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your homework
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your homework to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
