Watch the video (by clicking the image) or go through the following walk-through to learn how to submit your homework:

ONE TIME ONLY (START OF EVERY MODULE)

This module is slightly different as you have already done the one time setup for the homework repo in the previous module. We will be using the same fork as we used there (`https://www.github.com/HackYourHomework/Homework-classXX`).

EVERY WEEK

1. Do a `git pull` on your main branch to get the latest version.
2. Create a new branch for each week you have homework. For example, for the week 1 homework for Using API's create a branch called `YOUR_NAME-w1-UsingAPIs`. Don't forget to checkout this branch after creating it.
3. Make your homework!
4. Once you're finished, add your homework to a commit. There will be some test and config files added by the test runner, this is expected and should be added!
5. Create the commit (`git commit`). Make the commit message meaningful, for example `finished project for homework week1`.
6. Push the branch to your forked repository
7. On the GitHub page of your forked repository, click on the `create pull request` button. Make sure the `base repository` is your teacher's repository, on branch master
8. Give the pull request a title in the following format:

```markdown
Homework week 1 <Your name>
```

9. Submit the pull request from your forked repository branch into the `main` branch
