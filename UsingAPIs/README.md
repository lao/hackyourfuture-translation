# Module #4 - Using APIs (Frontend)

![Using APIs](./assets/usingapis.png)

Welcome to Using API's! Congratulations on making it this far. You're well on your way to the top!

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs!

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Learn what an `Application Programming Interface` (API) is
- Understand how to write more readable `asynchronous JavaScript`
- Connect with different `public APIs`
- Build a `Single Page Application` (SPA)

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 2 essential parts per week:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the homework. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture teachers. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the Using API's module. This is what you do...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `Using API's`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's homework (from the JavaScript2 module)
3. On **Friday** you start with the homework, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `Using API's`, that would be [Week1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the class channel
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend class. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your homework
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your homework to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
