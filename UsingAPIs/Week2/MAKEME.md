## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Prep exercises
3. Code along
4. Homework exercises
5. Interview preparation
6. Extra: Code along

## **1. Practice the concepts**

This week's concepts can be challenging, therefore let's get an easy introduction using some interactive exercises! Check the following resources out and start practicing:

- [Learn JavaScript: Requests I and II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-javascript/modules/intermediate-javascript-requests) (only the two lessons, not the articles/project and quiz)

This part also introduces you to some other concepts `XMLHttpRequest`

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your class and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `Using API's` fork, go to the folder `Week2`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **3. Code along**

In the following "code along" you'll be building a complete Weather App that makes use of the [Darksky API](https://darksky.net).

## **4. Homework exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (Using API's / Week 2). Have a look at the [homework guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/homework-handin-guide.md) to see how to hand in your homework.

*NOTE: do NOT forget to checkout the main branch before creating the branch for this week. Otherwise your previous homework will be a part of the PR*

## **5. Interview preparation**

After reading the info on the [‘Interview Preparation’ Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation), make a copy of [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/114rTGS4eG6tpkrMAyVIdvgTrnpmkRL6ax_smkw1B0HI/copy) and submit your answers to the team [here](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/s6zYAugm). These answers will help us assess how ready you are for interviews and we will also discuss your answers in the Career Training Session II which will happen this (or next) week. More information about this session will be shared on Slack!

## **6. Extra: Code along**

If you are done and want to practice some more, the following code along implements a GitHub profile finder using the GitHub API.

- [Using APIs in JavaScript - Create a Github Profile Finder Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJspH620ZsU)

He uses some things that will be new for you:
- `scss` - This is what is called a css precompiler that adds some functionality to your css. `sass` is another version of this. Some projects use these, some do not. It is not necessary to know what this does specifically.
- `package.json` commands with the `live server` extension. This is a way to set up a project, don't worry too much about understanding exactly how it works

## Done early?

Have a look at the project for next week and start thinking of ideas. You can even start a bit already if you wish, just remember to make sure all your homework is done beforehand!
