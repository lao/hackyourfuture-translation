## Homework HTML/CSS/GIT Week 2

> Create a directory "week2" inside your `HYF-Module-HTMLCSSGIT` directory on GitHub. There should already be a "week1" folder that contains your homework from the last week.

## Todo list

1. Prep exercises
2. GIT exercises
3. Responsive design challenges
4. Code along
5. PROJECT: Responsive website
6. Optional: Flexbox games

### 1. Prep exercises

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `HTML-CSS` fork, go to the folder `week2`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

### 2. GIT exercise

1.  Create a repository on Github called favorite-cmd-commands, make sure to check the checkmark about including a README file
2.  Clone that repository (Google how to clone a repository).
3.  Edit the `README.md` markdown file.
4.  Add bash commands that you like (at least 3) and style them as headers.
5.  Provide a short description (20 characters~) for each.
6.  Then `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` the file to your GitHub repository.

### 3. Responsive design challenges

Making websites that are `responsive` to a variety of device sizes (in other words, that still "look good" on any device), has become the standard way of building websites. You have to learn how to do this too. It's not as intimating as it might seem; you're **not** going to build a separate page for literally every device size out there.

Instead, you'll be applying certain CSS rules only to certain device sizes: the average desktop (1024px and more), the average tablet (between 600px and 1024px) and the average mobile device (600px and below).

In the following mini-course you'll get some practice in doing this:

### 4. Code along

In the following video you'll be rebuilding a responsive HTML5 website. Put your focus on how the structure of the page is built: First HTML to provide structure & content, and then the CSS. Look at the HTML tags used and the names given to classes.

### 5. PROJECT: Responsive website

> Before you start this exercises, make sure to create a folder inside the `hyf-html-exercises` folder. Create a `week2` folder and put this exercise files inside.

> Tip: Use GIT and GitHub along the way, you can easily use this project as part of your portfolio!

In this project you're going to rebuild `the homepage` of an existing responsive website. Choose one of the following:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/nl/nl/)
- [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [Triodos](https://www.triodos.nl/)

You don't have to build everything, but include the following requirements:

- Only rebuild the homepage (which should include a navigation bar, footer, the landing section and at least 2 other sections)
- Write your CSS in an external stylesheet
- You are **allowed** to use a CSS framework, but you do not have to. It is up to you!
- Make use of `flexbox`
- Download the assets (images, other forms of media) through the original webpage, or use your own!
- Use media queries for both tablet and mobile (This might be same for the website you're making)
- **Make use of GIT and GitHub** to keep track of your work. The name of the repository should web _WEBSITENAME-clone_

### 6. Optional: Flexbox games

If you like learning in a fun way there are quite a few games on the internet that teach you the way flexbox works:

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/)
- [Flexbox Adventure](https://codingfantasy.com/games/flexboxadventure)
