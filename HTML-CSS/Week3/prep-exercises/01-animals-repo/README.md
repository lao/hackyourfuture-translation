# Animals repo

In this homework you'll be working with GIT and GitHub. Follow the steps to learn how to create a remote repository and work with it from your local machine:

1. Create a repository on GitHub, called `animals`
2. Clone the repository to your local machine, using the SSH URL
3. Locally, create a file called "zoo.txt". Include 3 animals found in a zoo
4. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Make sure the commit message is meaningful (ex. "created txt file with animal names")
5. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
6. Go back to your local repository and create a branch called `new-feature`

> Tip: in software, a "feature" is a technical term that points to any functionality that a user can derive benefit from. For example, Facebook has many features: the ability to make a profile, like a post, place comments, etc.

7. Inside the new branch, create a file called "pets.txt". Include 3 animals that could be a pet
8. Also, add 2 more animals to the "zoo.txt" file
9. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Again, make sure the commit message is meaningful
10. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
11. On GitHub, find out how to merge branch `new-feature` into `main`
12. Merge the branches
13. Switch back to branch `main`
14. Pull the changes from your remote repository to your local repository, verify that everything worked

## Things to think about

- Why do you think we develop features in a branch rather than straight away pushed to `main`? Is there a situation that pushing to the `main` branch directly is better?
- What would happen if you create two different branches that edit the same file and then merge them after each other?
- Why do you think is the commit message important?
