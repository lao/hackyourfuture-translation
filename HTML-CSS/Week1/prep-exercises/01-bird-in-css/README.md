Your task is to create the following bird using just html and css:

Tips:

- The beak is probably the hardest and may need some googling on how you can do triangles in CSS.
- Remember to create an html as well as a css file, do not use inline styling!

## Things to think about

In this exercise you have seen that you can do quite cool things already with just some basic html/css knowledge. Before the session on Sunday, have a think about the following questions. You don't need to know or fill in the answers as they will be discussed on Sunday, but see if you can figure it out:

- Which html element(s) did you use for each of the shapes? Why did you use that one/those?
- If you couldn't change the css file that you just created but you are allowed to add a new css file, how would you change the color of the bird?
- Can you think of a reason why you sometimes cannot change a css file?
