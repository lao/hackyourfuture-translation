# Class repositories
The idea for the class repositories is to give each class a place to hand in their work, mostly their homework but also anything else you need them to hand in. It gives a nice tracker of the progress of the students and allows mentors 1 place to work from without classes overlapping.

## Setting up a new class repository
- Create a new *private* repository named `class-NUMBER` using this as template
- Edit the `README.md` file to fill in the class number (find/replace NUMBER with the number)
- Create a new issue for the class mentor to add their information and assign them to it, they can then test out the issue template. The issue template can be found in [./templates/add-info-issue.md](./templates/add-info-issue.md)
- Invite the students to the private repo before JavaScript module starts. Give them the Write role so they can create pull requests
