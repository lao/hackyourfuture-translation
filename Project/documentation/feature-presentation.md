## Feature Presentations (Group)

### Why feature presentations?

When working on software it’s useful to have several teams working on different parts of the same application. This makes the development of the software go faster and reduces the margin of error. But just because one team works on a certain feature doesn’t mean the rest will automatically know about it. This is why we have **feature presentations**: we want to make others aware of what’s been added, how it’s made and what the benefits of it are.

### Requirements for the presentation

In this presentation you’re going to present the feature you’ve been working on this week. It will be done together with your team members: each person takes ownership of and talks about their part in building the feature. The presentation should be done in the following structure:

1. First **give us the user experience** of the feature. Show what the new feature means for the user. Click, hover and play around with it to show the full capabilities of it.
2. Secondly, **talk about the code** that makes it work. Each team member describes their role in the realisation of the feature. In this section of the presentation it should be clear to the rest of the class (1) the benefit of the feature, (2) what the approach was, (3) what the role of each team member in the realisation of the feature was, and (4) an explanation of the feature code.
3. And lastly, the **Q&A**. After the presentation the rest will ask questions about the feature/teamwork.

### Tips

Here are some tips to keep in mind when preparing the presentation:

- Keep the slides short and to the point. There should be no full sentences, but only keywords that describe the core of the point you’re making.
- Each team member should “own” a part of the presentation content. Everyone should bring their perspective and describe their role in realising the feature.
- The presentation can’t last longer than 15 minutes.
